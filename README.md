AI-Driven Microfinance Optimization:

This project explores the integration of AI in microfinance to enhance borrower targeting, credit assessment, and risk mitigation. Traditional microfinance institutions face challenges such as high operational costs, inefficient credit evaluation, and slow KYC processes. Our AI-powered solution addresses these issues by leveraging:
  * AI-Driven Sales Intelligence – Optimizes borrower outreach by identifying high-approval regions.
  * Alternative Credit Scoring – Uses transactional and behavioral data (UPI transactions, mobile usage) to assess creditworthiness.
  * Automated KYC & Compliance – Accelerates verification with OCR, facial recognition, and fraud detection models.
  * AI-Based Default Prediction – Implements time-series forecasting and reinforcement learning for proactive risk management.
    
Industry Insights & AI Impact:
  * The microfinance sector is showing signs of stress, with rising delinquencies across all lender types and ticket sizes (RBI, Financial Stability Report).
  * Asset quality has deteriorated significantly in H1 FY25, with the share of loans overdue between 31-180 days doubling to 4.30% in September 2024 from 2.15% in March 2024 (RBI).
